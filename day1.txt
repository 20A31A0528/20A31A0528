* DATATYPES  IN  C :
     int - signed and unsigned(4 bytes)
    char-signed and unsigned(1 bytes)
    float-(4 bytes)
   double-(8 bytes)
   long-signed and unsigned(4 bytes)
   short-signed and unsigned(2 bytes)
   void

*PURPOSE OF DATATYPES :
    Memory is stored in stack. Memory will be allocated in stack and it is present in RAM.

*COMPILE  TIME :
     Input given at the time of writing program.Input is stored on stack which is stored on RAM .

*RUNTIME :
   Input is given by the user at the end of program.It is stored in heap which is stored on RAM.

*C  language  follows  ASCII  TABLE.We cant print name in telugu using c language.

                                                INTRODUCTION   TO   PYTHON 

*In python,specifing of datatypes is not required.It automatically identifies it.

*Python follows UNICODE table whose range is [-32768 to 3267].All language characters are supported   in unicode table.So we can print our name in telugu using python.

*IDE's and EDITORS :
     In IDE,we can run,save and write the program there itself.
    In Editors,we can type the program and save the program there but we can run the program.
  
*PYTHON  IDE's :
  Thony,pycharm,vscode,anaconda. 

*COMPILER :
   Compiler scans the entire program .While scaning the program , if any one error occur the entire   program gets jammed or collapsed.

*INTERPRETER :
    If the program gets any error only that line of code is skipped and the rest of the code gets executed.It        scans line by line. 

*Keywords are based on version of python.we use modules in python like header files in C.

*RULES FOR PROPER VARIABLE NAME :
   No special characters at the begginning except   ' _ ' .
   We can disable a invalid name by using ' # '.
   No number at the begginning .
   It should not contain white space.
   It should not start with keywords.

*VARIABLES :
    IT is used to store values.

*INPUT METHOD :
 Taking input from user.
