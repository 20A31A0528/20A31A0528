* SEPARATOR
what is the purpose of separator
separator separate each and every value.

*To enter the elements on the same line we should add "end=' ' ". so that the value come on same line.
END SEPARATE ONLY ONE VALUE AT A TIME.

* SPLIT
    It is mainly used for geting multiple inputs from the user along with white space at the same time .
    SYNTAX:
                     input().split(separator,maxsplit)
 
 *CONTROL STATEMENTS

  1) "== "does not compare datatype ,it only compares integers.
  2) "=== "compares both dagtatype and integer value.
 3) we use nested if to make our code strong.
  4)iteration codes are used for reducingsize of code.
 5)we use 'in' and 'notin' operator instaed of increment decrement operators in python.

*TRIANGLE PROBLEMS
   code contains two fors,1st for represent rows and second for represents columns.
                 for i in range(1,6):
                         for j in range(1,6): 
each and every your outer(row) for iteration is intialised and column is re-initialised.

*list 
 1)it is recognised by square brackets.
2)using "len" method we can find length of string.
